x = 2.9
print(round(x)) (gives output of nearby value)

Output : 3

x = 2.9
print(abs(-x)) (gives ouput of nearby values even input number is negative)

output : 3 

import math
print(math.ceil(2.9)) (Gives nearby value greater than input)

output : 3

import math
print(math.floor(2.9)) (Gives nearby value less than output)

output : 2
